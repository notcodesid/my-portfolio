        <div className="space-y-6 text-muted">
          <p>in a world obsessed with specialization, being a generalist feels almost rebellious. everyone tells you to "niche down" and become the best at one thing. but what if there's power in knowing a little about a lot?</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">the case for generalists</h2>
          <p>generalists connect dots that specialists can't see. they bring ideas from different fields and create something new. the most innovative solutions often come from people who can think across disciplines.</p>
          <p>think about it: the best product managers aren't just coders or designers—they understand both. the best founders aren't just technical or business-minded—they're a mix of everything.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">the information age advantage</h2>
          <p>we live in a time where information is everywhere. you can learn anything online, often for free. this means the barrier to becoming a generalist has never been lower.</p>
          <p>want to learn design? youtube. want to understand blockchain? twitter threads. want to code? countless free resources.</p>
          <p>the question isn't whether you can learn—it's whether you will.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">t-shaped skills</h2>
          <p>the sweet spot might be what they call "t-shaped skills"—deep expertise in one area (the vertical bar) and broad knowledge across many areas (the horizontal bar).</p>
          <p>you're really good at one thing, but you understand enough about other things to collaborate effectively and see the bigger picture.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">my approach</h2>
          <p>i'm trying to be a generalist with depth. i code, but i also care about design. i build products, but i also write. i'm into web3, but i also study traditional systems.</p>
          <p>is it the most efficient path? probably not. is it the most interesting? absolutely.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">the future belongs to adaptable minds</h2>
          <p>the world is changing fast. jobs that exist today might not exist tomorrow. skills that are valuable now might become obsolete.</p>
          <p>in this environment, the ability to learn quickly and adapt might be more valuable than deep expertise in any single domain.</p>
          <p>generalists are built for this uncertainty. they're not tied to one path—they can pivot, evolve, and find new opportunities.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">conclusion</h2>
          <p>don't let anyone make you feel bad for being curious about many things. your diverse interests aren't a weakness—they're a superpower waiting to be unleashed.</p>
          <p>explore widely. learn constantly. connect the dots.</p>
          <p>the world needs more people who can see the whole picture, not just the pixels.</p>
