          <p>so, i was reading this blog by sam altman, how to hire, and it got me thinking: as developers, we really need to understand what founders want from us.</p>
          <p>here's what i picked up, and honestly, it's pretty straightforward!</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">take your time to find the right job</h2>
          <p>founders spend a lot of time hiring, so we should do the same when we're job hunting.</p>
          <p>it's not just about doing one interview and calling it a day.</p>
          <p>spend time getting to know the company, what they do, and how you fit in.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">get involved early</h2>
          <p>don't just show up and use big words to impress.</p>
          <p>instead, show them you're interested by getting involved early.</p>
          <p>offer to help out, even before you get hired.</p>
          <p>this shows you're serious and want to be part of the team.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">be proactive</h2>
          <p>founders love people who take initiative.</p>
          <p>don't wait for them to tell you what to do.</p>
          <p>come up with ideas, suggest improvements, and show that you're thinking ahead.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">do a trial project</h2>
          <p>this is a big one.</p>
          <p>if you can, offer to do a small project or task before getting hired.</p>
          <p>it gives the founder a chance to see you in action, and it gives you a feel for what working at the company will be like.</p>
          <p>plus, it's way better than just talking in interviews.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">conclusion</h2>
          <p>and that's it!</p>
          <p>i got this idea after reading sam's blog, and it really made things clear.</p>
          <p>getting hired isn't just about the interview, it's about showing you're the right fit from day one.</p>
