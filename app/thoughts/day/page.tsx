        <div className="space-y-6 text-muted">
          <p>first things first, make the bed. because you can't code your way to greatness with a wrinkled sheet. can you? salt water in hand, trying to summon an endorphin rush. a bit of liquid luck, because i'll need it today. five minutes of meditation to stop obsessing about how much i'm not doing.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">morning routine</h2>
          <p>pretending it's meditation, when really i'm just trying not to spiral into "i should be doing more." wild, right? i barely know how blockchains work, but here i am, bagging a $2.5k web3 grant like i accidentally typed the right proposal.</p>
          <p>black coffee with no sugar, because today's not handing out wins for free.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">work mode</h2>
          <p>now comes the 20 yrs old engineer building a full product from scratch. zero to deployed. mirror check. yup—still that guy.</p>
          <p>laptop open. nyc morning up on the screen like it knows i'm dreaming of something bigger. the best view after i woke up. it's a reminder to move to nyc.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">web3 project</h2>
          <p>i've got this react native plus solana app breathing down my neck. i don't fully speak the language of web3 yet, but that's never stopped me before. fake it till i ship it—or till it stops throwing weird errors. either works.</p>
          <p>then it's onto system design. not the "youtube thumbnail with a diagram and dramatic music" kind. i'm talking real, foundational stuff—the architecture that keeps the castle standing, written by the guy i'm inspired by daily: @shivambhadani_. it's dense. but it's also the kind of thing that makes me feel like i'm leveling up, stat by stat.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">evening cricket</h2>
          <p>evening rolls around, and it's time to switch roles. cricket in the evening. turning into kohli when the pressure's on. i lace up like it's the world cup final. the moment i pick up the bat, i'm virat kohli chasing down 180 with calm eyes and calculated aggression.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">exploring ai</h2>
          <p>and if time grants me a little bonus xp, i'll peek into the world of ai agents. these things are wild—little digital brains with potential that makes your head spin. might not understand it all yet, but curiosity doesn't wait for permission.</p>
          <p>so yeah—code, architecture, cricket, and curiosity.</p>

          <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold text-foreground pt-4">balancing act</h2>
          <p>being an engineer? just one of the roles i juggle. like spider-man, but the only thing i'm swinging between is a dozen tabs and my task list.</p>
          <p>write the todos. write the code. write the story.</p>
          <p>but somehow, this chaos clicks together—barely. and i wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
          <p className="pt-4">until then,<br />siddharth</p>
