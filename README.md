Welcome to the **notcodesid.com** repository — this repo contains the code for my personal website and portfolio.

## 👋 About Me

Hi, I’m **Siddharth** — a 21-year-old **engineer, web3 learner, and creator**. I write about what I’m learning (especially on Medium) and share reflections on life and tech.  [oai_citation:1‡Not Codesid](https://www.notcodesid.com/)

I’m currently working on **Proven**, a habit-staking app on **Solana** where users bet on their goals and earn rewards for consistency, and I contribute to the **SuperteamIN** ecosystem. Previously, I worked as a **software engineer intern at a Web2 startup**.  [oai_citation:2‡Not Codesid](https://www.notcodesid.com/)
